***IntHistogram***
We store the total number of fields in an integer and the distribution in an array. When addValue method is called, we increment the count of the corresponding bucket by one. The method estimateSelectivity is the most important one. We calculate the selectivity of EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQ, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQ. The overall idea is the size of buckets divided by total size.

***TableStats***
This class keeps a series of static variables and methods that take care of the statistics for all the tables of the database, while the non-static methods take care of a corresponding table. In the constructor of the class, we calculate the total number of tuples of the table by iterate through the heap file and add up the number of tuples of each page. The most important method is estimateSelectivity. We firstly get the type of the field, which is either integer or string. For both of the condition, we iterate through all the tuples in the heap file storing the table and add then into the histogram. Then we call the estimateSelectivity method of histogram to get the selectivity and return it.

***Join Cost Estimation***
The method estimateJoinCost is as easy as implementing the formula. The method estimateTableJoinCardinality is just about taking care of a few conditions and return the corresponding quantity.

***Join Ordering***
The method orderJoins is simply converting the pseudocode, calling the method enumerateSubsets and computeCostAndCardOfSubplan, if the cost is smaller adding into the PlanCache and finally returning the best plan.


Change to API:
The IntHistogram requires min and max to construct, so we add a setMinMax method to the class.
