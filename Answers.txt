Design Decisions:
•	Tuple.java
Added: Tuple Id, Record Id and a list for Fields
•	TupleDesc.java
Added: Number of Fields and a list for Fields in TupleDesc
•	Catalog.java
Added: Database File, Name and one Primary Key for each table
List for implementing Tables. No reason for choosing a list. We may implement it with hash map in the future.
•	BufferPool.java
Hash map from Page Id to Buffer Pool items. Each Buffer Pool item consists of a Page, Transaction Id and Permission.
•	HeapPageId.java
We implemented hashCode based on this formula:
hashCode(a, b) = (a + b)*(a + b + 1)/2 + a
Makes sure the hash for the same entry is always the same. Also the hash for two different entries can’t be the same.
•	RecordId.java
Same algorithm for hashing. In here we just hash pid and then hash the result with tupleno.
•	HeapPage.java
Simple mathematic formula for finding slot’s id in the page.
•	HeapFile.java
